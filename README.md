# TTL Changer Plugin

A Steam Deck plugin that changes the system TTL (Time To Live) value to 65 for improved network compatibility with mobile hotspots and carrier networks.

## Features

- üîß Change system TTL value to 65 with one click
- üìä Display current TTL value
- üîÑ Reset TTL to default system value (usually 64)
- ‚ö° Real-time status updates
- üõ°Ô∏è Safe TTL modification with proper validation

## Why Change TTL?

Many mobile carriers and hotspot providers use TTL values to detect tethering usage. By setting your Steam Deck's TTL to 65, packets from your device will appear to come from a regular mobile device (which typically have TTL 64 after one hop), helping avoid potential throttling or restrictions.
